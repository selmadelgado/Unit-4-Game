// Pseudo Code

// A game with 4 Crystals and Random Value/Result 

// The player is shown a random number and four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

// The random number at the start of the game is between 19-120

// Each crystal has a random value between 1-12.

// A new random number is generated and assigned to each crystal everytime we win or lose

// When the player clicks on a crystal, the player's score counter is updated with that value until the total score is matches or exceeds the random number.

// If the total score equals the random number, increment the win counter.

// The player loses if their score exceeds the random number.

// The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

//The app keeps track of and shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
