Instructions:

The player is presented with a random number at the start of the game. 

There are four crystals on the page and each crystal has a hidden value.  When the player clicks on a crystal, the value of the crystal is added to their total score.

The player wins the game by matching their total score to the random number. 

If the user's total score is higher than the random number, they lose the game.
